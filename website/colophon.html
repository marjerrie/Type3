      </br></br>

      </br></br>
        Patua One is a slab serif text type designed for use in small sizes. It has low contrast and strong serifs and is intended to generate visual impact. Its thick serifs are curved to provide it with a touch of smoothness and gesture. It was designed by Latinotype (http://latinotype.com/), a typeface foundry based in Concepción and Santiago, Chile created in 2007 whose goal is to “design new typeface with high quality products for the contemporary design industry.” This typeface is only accessible through Google Fonts and is meant for web design. 
      </br></br>
        Lato is a sans serif typeface family started in the summer of 2010 by Warsaw-based designer Łukasz Dziedzic (“Lato” means “Summer” in Polish). In December 2010 the Lato family was published under the Open Font License by his foundry tyPoland, with support from Google. Łukasz is a Warsaw-based designer. During Poland's first free elections in 1989, he joined Gazeta Wyborcza, the first independent daily newspaper, and soon found a home in the design department co-creating page layouts and his first typeface. In 2007, he created a three-style Latin and Cyrillic corporate family for empik, one of Poland’s largest retail networks. In 2010, he started the Lato project, to develop a high-quality open-source font family.
      </br></br>
        Slovenian type designer Mitja Miklavcic created this serif FontFont between 2008 and 2010. The family has 14 weights, ranging from Thin to Black (including italics) and is ideally suited for advertising and packaging, book text, editorial and publishing, logo, branding and creative industries, poster and billboards, small text as well as web and screen design.
