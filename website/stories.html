        <p>I grew up in Union City and went to Cedar Elementary School and the majority of the kids who went to that school were any sort of Mexican descent. I definitely felt more in-tune with them and developed close relationships with them than I did with say someone who is Japanese or Chinese. For some reason I had no relationship with anyone who was Chinese; I felt like they were different. We were considered Asian but they were like different from me. I couldn’t relate to them. Even down to how they eat. It was my Latino friends I definitely was thinking like “Okay, we’re the same.”</br></br>I think it’s absolutely necessary and crucial to feel connected to your heritage because then, from what I’ve experienced if you don’t, you fall into an identity crisis and you don’t know who to turn to, you don’t know how to relate to anybody. We borrow Black music and we can feel it and we can feel empowered by it but that isn’t us. We have our own struggles and if we don’t have our own music—if we don’t have our own culture to reference to—then we get lost. We’re too Americanized for our Filipino communities and then too Filipino for our white communities.

        </br></br>I really feel like Filipinos who are in our peer group are in some sort of identity crisis. Maybe some of us don’t know it because we’re in America and we’re Americanized and we’re borrowing everything from the things that are around us like the music and the way we dress, but how connected are we to our culture other than our food and Manny Pacquiao. Who are the people we can look up to? </br></br>I have dreams of us coming out of the woodwork and coming out of the shadows to help each other come to terms with our identity while also creating our own thing—kind of like re-inventing who we are—and stepping away from the Americanization and the Westernization while embracing where we come from, but also filtering that out because there is so much colonization attached to our history. I don’t feel alone in it. I just don’t think we have the confidence. Who are we as Filipinos? I think that if we’re able to have these conversations and kind of dig deeper, we’ll be able to find that confidence and create something because maybe we don’t have anything; we have to create it. I think right now is just a great time to start.</p>

        <p>I’m from Nevada, California. It’s like an hour from here actually over the Golden Gate Bridge. It’s in Marin County which is a mostly white county so the demographics, as I remember them (I grew up there. I was there for 18 years), it was a lot of older white folks in some very rich parts, Latinos, and Asian Americans. I had like three Filipinos in my class and it was a small Catholic school so we only had about 26 kids. I’m always glad that I had those three or four Filipinos in my class. </br></br><b><i>How would you have described that connection?</i></b></br> I think we just bonded over [our ethnicity] even over simple things. All of us were Fil-Ams and none of us knew Tagalog so we were all on the same boat so the things we would bond over would be things like the food, the relationships with parents or grandparents, swear words, etc. and then looking Filipino was a part of that bond as well.</br></br><b><i>Do you wish you spoke Tagalog?</i></b></br> I do actually. So Freshman year was when I started to de-pack it more. I think freshman year I took more of an initiative to try and learn Tagalog and do it more as an active exploration of my roots and I was more disappointed that I didn’t know Tagalog, like a lot of kids are, but now it’s just where I’m at. It’s just a trade-off when you’re second-gen or third-gen [because] our parents do a lot of work to assimilate and they don’t have a lot of the time and energy...so it makes sense that Tagalog wasn’t a necessity. My goal is to learn it before I have kids so that I can...<b><i>Teach it to your kids?</i></b> Yeah.</br></br><b><i>So do you think that it’s necessary to learn Tagalog? How does the correlation between knowing Tagalog…how that correlate with your connection to our culture?</i></b></br>I think for one it gives you a bit of insight to the ideas and cultural values like closeness, community. In the language there’s a lot of that just from the little that I know which is important in this Western context to have that. Because it’s not a necessity as much in the Philippines and there’s a lot of English speakers, I feel like it’s even more important here. With talking about diaspora and blacks in the States, [they] kind of created a new culture that was a version of African rituals mixed with American culture and it made them more rooted even though it wasn’t the same as in Africa.  That’s where I feel like we’re related to the African diaspora in that it is a goal for us. Trying to know Tagalog even though we’re in the States and then create communities here, trying to have it flourish here.
