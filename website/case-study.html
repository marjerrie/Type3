        <p>Initially choosing a topic for this project was difficult. It was imperative to me to choose something I felt deeply for. I couldn’t just arbitrarily pick a topic that was “meaningful.” It needed to resonate with me on a deeper level and figuring that out required some digging.
      </br></br>
        Despite the, what seemed to be, ever changing topic, everything I wanted to work with involved the idea of identity. Originally, I had decided to work with first-generation Asian Americans and how growing up with Eastern ideals in a Western world had affected their personal sense of self. I chose this because it was and still is something I continually battle with. However, it proved itself to be too extensive of a topic to work with in the time span we were given and ultimately, I wasn’t confident enough with this topic to keep working with it. 
      </br></br>
        I eventually realized that the only way to move forward was to focus on Filipino Americans because that’s a more complete part of my identity than anything else making the connection to my work much more instant and prominent. What sparked this realization was Anthony Ocampo’s <i>The Latinos of Asia</i>. I came across this title in my search for relevant information on the preceding idea. I had been jumping back and forth between staying broad or honing my content for weeks, but finding this solidified my intent.
      </br></br>
        By reading through several articles and listening to interviews on this book, I fostered the idea of discussing how the ambivalent nature of the Filipino race—the ambivalence rooted in our culture’s over 400+ years of unwanted colonization first by Spain in 1521 and later by the U.S. in 1898—has affected one’s sense of identity with fellow peers between the ages of 18-25. 
      </br></br>
        As I started having conversations with others, however, my topic organically transformed into something much more powerful. Everyone I’ve spoken with all seem yearn to feel a stronger connection to our Filipino heritage. This broken connection had a greater prevalence to one’s sense of identity than the ambivalence of our race. 
      </br></br>
        My natural reaction was to create a book with the content I acquired, but through time it didn’t seem enough. Even though a book would’ve still been able to reach a large audience, it felt too contained and confined. I needed to share this on a larger scale and thus creating a website became appropriate. On the other hand, some of the words and stories I collected became too precious to live on-screen. Reading them online would communicate a different mood and thus an accompanying zine that readers would receive by signing up for the website’s newsletter was produced.
      </br></br>
        <i><b>Bagong Sarili</b></i> seeks to start a conversation amongst young adults about our identities as Filipino Americans as well as create a community empowering people to explore and learn more about our Filipino heritage in order to establish a stronger connection to the culture.
